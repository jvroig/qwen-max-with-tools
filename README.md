# Qwen-Max with Filesystem Tools

## Overview

This repository, **qwen-max-with-tools**, provides a web-based chat interface and Python API backend that equips the Qwen-Max language model with powerful filesystem manipulation tools. These tools allow users to interact with their local or remote filesystem through natural language queries or direct API calls.

**Important Note**: This is an **educational implementation** designed to demonstrate how tool-calling works with Large Language Models (LLMs). It is **not intended for production use**. Please exercise caution when using this code, especially when interacting with sensitive filesystems. Always ensure proper security measures are in place if deploying similar solutions in real-world scenarios.


### Features

- **Get Current Working Directory**: Retrieve the current working directory.
- **Read Files**: Read the contents of files within the filesystem.
- **Write Files**: Write content to files in the filesystem.
- **Create Directories**: Create new directories in the filesystem.
- **List Directory Contents**: List all files and directories in a specified path (or the current working directory).

### Tools Description

1. **get-cwd**
    - **Description**: Get the current working directory.
    - **Parameters**: None.
    - **Returns**: String - information about the current working directory.

2. **read-file**
    - **Description**: Read a file in the filesystem.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `path` (required, string): Path and filename of the file to read.
    - **Returns**: String - the contents of the file specified in `path`.

3. **write-file**
    - **Description**: Write content to a file in the filesystem.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `path` (required, string): Path and filename of the file to write.
      - `content` (required, string): The content to write to the file.
    - **Returns**: String - confirmation message indicating success or failure.

4. **create-directory**
    - **Description**: Create a new directory in the filesystem.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `path` (required, string): Path of the directory to create.
    - **Returns**: String - confirmation message indicating success or failure.

5. **list-directory**
    - **Description**: List the contents of a directory in the filesystem.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `path` (optional, string): Path of the directory to list. If not provided, lists the current working directory.
    - **Returns**: String - a list of files and directories in the specified path.

### Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jvroig/qwen-max-with-tools.git
   cd qwen-max-with-tools

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Run the Backend API Server**

    ```bash
    python setup.py #this will install dependencies and create start.sh file
    bash start.sh #this will start the API server
    ```
    This will start the Python backend server on http://localhost:5001.

### Access the Web Interface

In your file browser, double-click the file index.html to load the chat interface in your default browser.

The web interface allows you to communicate with Qwen-Max using natural language commands. You can use it to perform operations like reading files, writing content, creating directories, etc., simply by typing instructions such as:

"Get the current working directory."
"Read the file at path /example/path/to/file.txt."
"Write 'Hello World' to the file at /example/path/to/file.txt."
"Create a new directory at /example/path/to/newdir."
"List the contents of the directory at /example/path/to/dir."

Enjoy interacting with Qwen-Max powered by filesystem tools!
